Welcome to the experiment!
</p>
<p>
You can find an information sheet with specifics about this study (purposes, contact information, etc) <a href="https://github.com/ChrisSantosLang/MADChairs/blob/main/Media/info.pdf?raw=true">here</a>. A link to the information sheet will also be provided at the end of the study.

<p>
You will either play a game or will serve as an alternate. Alternates make sure that we will have enough people to play the game (we need five), but alternates do not actually play. When the maximum number of players has been reached, we will send a message via Prolific to any players who have not yet reached the waiting room to inform them that they have been alternates and will be approved and paid &pound;2.5. To save yourself time, you may want to check for that message when you enter the waiting room. However, you must click back into the waiting room page to count as being in the waiting room.

If you decide to take part in the study, you can withdraw at any point by closing the browser tab and clicking "Stop Without Completing" on Prolific. To continue with the study, click the "Next" button below.
